## Stages:

### PreDevelopment:

#### Design Standards:
- Set UI standards for consistent design across the apps.
- Define a color palette and style that will be used universally.
- Specify fonts to be used across the apps.
- Choose a styling library or API (e.g., native wind or Emotion).
- Establish media query guidelines for responsive design.
- Define the overall theme for a cohesive user experience.
- Curate brand images and UI images to maintain visual consistency.
- Set up translations for multiple languages (e.g., English and Arabic).
- Assign language IDs for internationalization.

#### Style Components:
- Create basic style components for reuse.
- Develop typography components for consistent text styling.
- Design layouts that can be used universally.

#### Structure and Content:
- Define the app's structure and layout.
- Plan the formation and content strategy.
- Create a prototype for visualizing the app's structure.

#### Project Setup:
- Establish linting standards for code quality.
- Define linting rules for maintaining a clean codebase.
- Structure the project to maintain organization.
- Set up APIs for data retrieval and management.
- Plan navigation throughout the app.
- Determine the use of external APIs or proprietary ones.
- Define the stages of feature/page development.
- Determine state and storage management methods.
- Outline the approach for managing Facebook pages and groups.
- Determine the components to be used across features/pages.
- Specify sounds and icons for a consistent user experience.
- Establish system rules, including political considerations.
- Plan optimization methods for fonts and files.

#### Decision Making:
- Determine app features and pages.
- Decide how state and storage will be managed.
- Decide on the use of external APIs.
- Plan the development stages of features/pages.

### Development:

#### Component Development:
- Begin by creating basic components.
- Implement typography and layout components.
- Develop reusable UI elements for consistency.
- Create modular components for easy integration.

#### Feature/Page Development:
- Follow the pre-defined stages for each feature/page.
- Build components specific to each feature/page.
- Implement navigation between features/pages.
- Manage state and storage according to the pre-determined plan.
- Utilize APIs for data retrieval and updates.
- Integrate Facebook page and group functionalities.
- Implement sound and icon elements for enhanced user experience.
- Apply system rules and considerations for political aspects.

#### Testing:
- Conduct unit testing for individual components.
- Perform integration testing for features/pages.
- Ensure responsiveness and compatibility across devices.
- Test the app's interaction with Facebook pages and groups.
- Evaluate sound and icon usage for appropriateness.

#### Iterative Development:
- Collect feedback from testing phases.
- Iterate on features/pages based on user feedback.
- Continuously refine and optimize code.
- Update components and styles as needed.

### Final Touch:

#### Optimization:
- Optimize fonts and file sizes for improved performance.
- Implement lazy loading for efficient resource usage.
- Fine-tune media queries for better responsiveness.

#### Polishing:
- Review and refine UI elements for a polished look.
- Ensure consistency in color, style, and branding.
- Double-check translations for accuracy.
- Polish user interactions and animations.
- Verify that the app complies with system rules.

#### Performance Testing:
- Conduct performance testing to identify bottlenecks.
- Address any issues related to app speed and responsiveness.
- Optimize database queries and API calls.

#### Security Check:
- Perform a security audit to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Implement secure coding practices.
- Ensure data encryption for sensitive information.

#### Deployment:
- Prepare the app for deployment to production.
- Choose a suitable hosting environment.
- Deploy the app, considering scalability.
- Monitor for any issues in the live environment.

#### Maintenance:
- Establish a plan for ongoing maintenance.
- Monitor user feedback and address issues promptly.
- Keep components and libraries up-to-date.
- Plan for future feature updates and improvements.
