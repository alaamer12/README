	to be honest im actually dont know anymore what is the idea
	i belive our app was focusing on help 3rd grades but its likely i peeked into the furture
	motophorically that the app maybe not only for third grades but for all grades
	this is what i became to belive in,
	i wanted in this app to provide a stream of posts about education fillterized
	i wanted to provide chatting, i want to provide classes[teachers , students]
	i want to provide scoring system , maybe i wanted likely to provide 
	two modes for the application[surfing, studying]
	i wanted to provide goals , statistics
	i wanted to provide leaderboard
	i wanted to provide reels of education videos
	i wanted to provide comprehensive notifications features
	i wanted to provide special treatment based on student or instructor
	i wanted to provide communities in-app and out-app
	i wanted to provide i88n and localization 
	i wanted to create social media app that doesnt distract u on studying
	#i wanted to provide an app that u can learn from , to be useful for u , to be able
		to get what u want or what u want to see in no time, i wanted to be like a library
		for studying resources
	#i wanted the app to be professional but also simple
	i wanted to provide some utils for studying like grapping[scrapping] the degree,
	AI tools, chatbots, ...etc...
	i wanted to provide QA section[tab]
	
	i think those all the feaures would be found if the application is done
	but now lets revise the compatitors,
	most of them provide the `classes`
	most of them goals
	some provide scores, statistics, QA,Leaderboard , AI tools and teacher-student features
	few of them provide reels , stream of posts
	none provides library resources, reels, scrapping tools, full chatting system and fillterized posts
		outer services ,comprehensive notifications features,communities in/out-app[discord, telegram]
		localization
