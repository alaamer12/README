this is a notes of apis oe tech we have known :
next : it is SSR like-react
Nuxt : it is like next but for vue
vite or vitest : it is CSR for many Frameworks and has optimized builder 
RNUI : abbrev for react native ui lib it is a lib which has comprehensive components and big size and a lot of utils
RN kitten : it is ui for react native based on  eva desgin system,
eva design system : it is a system for colouring and theming and more 
Tamagui : it is ui lib and optimized compiler as they said for react native and web (can be next or vite)
solito : it is a lib for react native which allowed u to use react native and next js together in one code
turbo : it a builder for monorepo and optimized data cache and it can cache it remotely with price and it also generates workspaces and codes
and turbo is built on plop which it is a code generator so every valid config for plop is valid config for turbo
there is only lerna and Nx as monorepos builders
yeomon: also is a code generators and it looks like it is more popular a bit than plop
manypkg: it is special cli targets.json file to get the error inside it in monorepos which it is a lot useful
install : it looks a lib to fix some problems with commonjs and web browser where comonjs doesnt look to be built in so it requires a little steps , and this lib requires some config
burnt: which is a toast component and it was used at tamagui i dont know why
dotenv : it is a lib allow u to use .env and proccess.env , some of the tech is built in where u dont need to use it and others no 
check-dependencies-version-consistency: it is like manypkg and maybe offers more idk
depcheck- check dependacies,
npm-check: also
npm-check-updates : Also but with option to update
note that they usually dont concern for a needing library like when moti is needing reanimated they will think that reanimated is unused
crossenv : a lib to make sure the env is working across all platforms (in development)
doppler : is a platform for secret ops and so on , it keeps the secrets as apis and so on
hoist-non-react-statics : it is a way to share props or statics between components and it is used for class components which it is old
tsup : Bundle your TypeScript library with no config, powered by esbuild
Prisma : Is a database toolkit and ORM [object-rational-mapping] , helping managing a database and manipulate them
np: it looks this a package for better publishing on npm `npm publish` NOT SUPPORTING monorepo

zod: it is validation library where the validation libraires are a a libs for makinga scheme and validate and parse
	they are likely provide easier way with them however u still can do it with plain javascript 
	but they shorten the code and also provide more user-friendly and ensures no errors and leaks
	and ZOD one of the most popular once which also provides typescript in it which doesnt make u to provide
	type annotations 
	
joi: it is considered more extensive than joi and provides more functionallties and it is extensionable
yup: same, but simpler than both of them
validator: same, but in more focus on validation
avaj: same, but supports extensively work with json and constructors
superstruct: same, but lightwieght and simpler

lint-staged: it is liker a linter for some files or on stages depending on git,
	it likes it is linting the files will be commited or something like that
	
eslint-plugin-unicorn : it looks a loved plugin from a lot it has over 100 rules
	and it also supports `--fix`
	
@commitlint/cli: it is a cli to enforce the commit message to git by it is like a linting or
	a rules should the developer follow to get clear and understandable commit and to be consistant in CHANGELOG
and it uses as @commitlint/config-conventional as pre-configured rules

react-query-kit: it looks like a way to help with query and it is like provides more type safe ,...etc.
	but i really dont know as i havent worked with query before
@tanstack/react-query: it looks like a community of react-query where react-qurey usually used for
	fetch, cache and update data	
	
react-hook-form: it is just a validator hook for forms
react-error-boundary: it is a way to provide a fallback for a ui when errors occure but and
	it looks like it works on react, react-native, expo but it has to be client side
	
app-icon-badge: it renders forground badge over ur app icon and it looks like it have been developed throw
	obytes 
expo-build-properties: it is a way to customize the build confiuration and it looks it also works
	with `expo prebuild`

@hookform/resolvers: it a reslover for scheme which means it used with validation libraries as yup or zod
	and it also needs u to use react-hook-form
	so the three libs work together

@bacons/link-assets: it is a linker where it links the assits into native build so it enables 
	sync loading, it looks like it works only in development or something like that so it maybe 
	a tool to help in development in native projects
	
curl -Ls "https://get.maestro.mobile.dev" | bash : it is a script runs on cli for UI [e2e] testing
	and it looks so good
	
only-allow: it allows only one package manger 

husky: it is widely used for more than 10 millions and it provides hooks for git
