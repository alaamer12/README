# API and Technology Notes

## Next.js
Next.js is a Server-Side Rendering (SSR) framework, similar to React.

## Nuxt.js
Nuxt.js is the Vue.js counterpart to Next.js, providing SSR capabilities for Vue applications.

## Vite / Vitest
Vite is a Client-Side Rendering (CSR) solution optimized for various frameworks, equipped with an optimized builder.

## RNUI (React Native UI)
RNUI is an abbreviation for React Native UI library, featuring comprehensive components, extensive utilities, and a larger size.

## RN Kitten
RN Kitten is a UI library for React Native based on the Eva Design System.

## Eva Design System
Eva Design System is a system designed for coloring, theming, and more, enhancing the UI development experience.

## Tamagui
Tamagui serves as a UI library and an optimized compiler, suitable for React Native and web applications (compatible with Next.js or Vite).

## Solito
Solito is a library for React Native that enables the concurrent use of React Native and Next.js within a single codebase.

## Turbo
Turbo is a builder for monorepos, featuring optimized data caching that can be done remotely with pricing options. It generates workspaces and codes, built on Plop, a code generator.

## Lerna and Nx
Lerna and Nx are both monorepo builders.

## Yeoman
Yeoman is a popular code generator, slightly more popular than Plop.

## Manypkg
Manypkg is a special CLI targeting a `targets.json` file, providing error insights in monorepos.

## Install
Install is a library designed to address problems with CommonJS and web browsers. It requires specific configurations.

## Burnt
Burnt is a toast component used in Tamagui, but its exact purpose is unclear.

## Dotenv
Dotenv is a library that allows the use of `.env` files and `process.env`. Some technologies have built-in support, while others require its use.

## Check-dependencies-version-consistency
Similar to Manypkg, this tool checks dependencies for version consistency, possibly offering more features.

## Depcheck
Depcheck is a tool for checking dependencies.

## Npm-check
Npm-check is another tool for checking dependencies.

## Npm-check-updates
Similar to Npm-check, this tool provides an option to update dependencies.

Note: Libraries may not always consider the necessity of a library. For instance, when Moti requires Reanimated, it might be considered unused.

## Crossenv
Crossenv is a library ensuring environmental variables work consistently across all platforms during development.

## Doppler
Doppler is a platform designed for managing secret operations, storing secrets such as APIs securely.

## Hoist-non-react-statics
Hoist-non-react-statics facilitates sharing props or statics between components, especially useful for class components.

## Tsup
Tsup allows bundling TypeScript libraries with no configuration, powered by esbuild.
